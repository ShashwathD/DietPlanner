# DietPlanner
An app that creates a diet plan for you based on your demographic, diet restrictions, and goals

This project will take the user's demographic information as well as any dietary restrictions and health goals. It will then submit this data to a CoreML model and provide recommendations on foods to avoid and foods to eat. This information is also sent to GPT-4, which will generate a more comprehensive meal plan based on the recommendations & plan
